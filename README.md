Supervised Machine Learning prediction using Gaussian Naive Bayes 


1. EDA - including missing value replacement and correlation analysis 

2. Check for normality and identify predictors 

3. Attribute selection & build GNB predictor - iteration 1

4. Attribute selection & build GNB predictor - iteration 2

5. Calculate and compare Accuracy Confusion Matrix and RoC in both iterations
